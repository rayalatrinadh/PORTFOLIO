   <h3>Capgemini Technologies</h3>
   <p>Capgemini Technologies, Chennai, India
    Associate Consultant, April 2021 – November 2022
    
    As an Associate Consultant at Capgemini Technologies, I played a crucial role in the development and implementation of various projects. I worked in an Agile environment, actively participating in Scrum meetings to ensure the delivery of high-quality deliverables within the specified timelines.
    
    One of my key responsibilities was developing the UI component architecture for a developer framework using Angular 4, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap. I created custom, self-contained, reusable, and testable Angular 4 modules, controllers, directives, and services to implement essential functionalities for customer account summary.
    
    In order to enhance user experience and data validation, I utilized Angular 4 HTTP Services for asynchronous validations of input fields, leveraging existing data in the database. I also worked on setting up routing configurations using Angular 4 router to enable seamless navigation between various views and subviews.
    
    Working in both production and development teams, I actively participated in the design and development of dynamic web pages. I utilized HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, SASS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Angular 4 to create single-page applications with dynamic content. Additionally, I customized Bootstrap classes using CSS preprocessors like SASS.
    
    To ensure efficient data retrieval and communication with the server-side, I employed AJAX calls to consume RESTful web services. The retrieved data was then rendered on PrimeNG data tables. Furthermore, I developed Angular custom pipes, specifically using the ngFor directive, to sort transaction history for defined users.
    
    In the realm of microservices, I worked with a Spring Boot-based architecture. I leveraged RESTful APIs to build, test, and deploy microservices. I also gained experience with Hystrix, fault tolerance, and circuit breaker patterns to enhance system resilience.
    
    For debugging purposes, I implemented log4j support to track system activities and server-side logins. To streamline the development process, I utilized Maven for build automation and GIT for effective code management, adhering to Agile practices. I also gained hands-on experience with CI/CD environments using Jenkins and Maven.
    
    In summary, my role as an Associate Consultant at Capgemini Technologies involved active participation in Agile development, contributing to UI component architecture, implementing key functionalities, utilizing Angular 4, working with microservices, and employing various tools and frameworks for efficient development and delivery of high-quality software solutions.

    Financial Software & Systems (F.S.S), Chennai, India
Software Engineer, August 2019 – April 2021

As a Software Engineer at Financial Software & Systems (F.S.S), I played a vital role in the development and implementation of software solutions. Here is an overview of my responsibilities and contributions during my tenure:

- Implemented the persistence layer using Hibernate, which facilitated interaction with the MySQL database. I leveraged Hibernate for object-relational mapping and persistence, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

- Utilized DOM parsing techniques to parse XML documents, and employed the XSLT API to handle XML parsing in an object-oriented manner. This allowed for effective manipulation and processing of XML data within the application.

- Implemented various design patterns such as DAO (Data Access Object) and Front Controller, which enhanced the maintainability and scalability of the software architecture.

- Developed RESTful web services using REST and JSON, as well as SOAP web services using JAX-WS. This involved designing and implementing APIs for seamless communication and integration with external systems.

- Developed application service components and configured beans using the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. Additionally, I contributed to the creation of Hibernate mapping files and generation of the database schema.

- Designed and developed message-driven beans, which consumed messages from the Java message queue. This allowed for asynchronous processing and improved system responsiveness.

- Implemented jQuery AJAX calls in JSP (JavaServer Pages) web pages to facilitate dynamic content rendering and seamless interaction with the server-side components.

- Created unit tests using the jUnit framework, following a test-driven development approach. I also developed unit and integration test cases to ensure the robustness and quality of the software solution.

- Worked with Maven, a build automation tool, to manage project dependencies and streamline the build process. This ensured consistent and reliable build configurations.

- Collaborated closely with the requirements team, testing team, and database administrators to gather project requirements, validate functionality, and ensure seamless integration with the database.

Overall, as a Software Engineer at Financial Software & Systems (F.S.S), I made significant contributions to the development of software solutions, leveraging technologies such as Hibernate, XML parsing, RESTful and SOAP web services, Spring IoC, jQuery, jUnit, and Maven. My collaborative approach and engagement with cross-functional teams ensured the successful delivery of high-quality software products.
